Hello Everyone !!!
Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
I'm excited to share my very first website, built using pure HTML, CSS, and some of Bootstrap (navbar)!

After a week of intense coding, Iâ€™ve finally completed this project, which revolves around my passion: Taekwondo.

As a Taekwondo World Champion, I recognized the need for a platform like this in my field. The website serves as a hub for displaying and managing registrations for Taekwondo competitions worldwide.

Future Improvements ðŸš€
I plan to enhance the website soon by integrating JavaScript and SQL, allowing for better data organization, interactivity, and dynamic features.

Check it out! ðŸ”—
Feel free to visit the website and share your thoughts! Your feedback is always welcome.

Thank You! ðŸ˜Š
I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Wishing you an amazing day!
